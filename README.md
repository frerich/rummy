# Rummy

To launch a separate container which builds and runs the application:

```
$ ./run.sh mix phx.server
```

During development, it might be more convenient to use

```
$ ./run.sh iex -S mix phx.server
```

...since that will also give you an interactive console which lets you interact
with the application at runtime.
